### Goal
Reinforcement learning approach to playing competitive Pokémon. Battling is done on Smogon's [Pokémon Showdown! battle simulator](http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/).

### Ideas to Explore
* Batch RL (experience replay/fitted Q iteration)
* Online TD Learning
* PG methods (DDPG)
* Monte Carlo Tree Search (with simplfied assumptions)
* Imitation learning with Smogon leaderboard
